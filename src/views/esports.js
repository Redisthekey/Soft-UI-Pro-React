              Let them choose first and then pick your character. It’s often the
              case that competitive players are only comfortable playing one
              character. If you can play multiple different characters, you
              should let the random players have the first choice to maximize
              your chances of winning the match.

              Aim Lab is great for FPS players, but you’re much better off
              actually practicing in the Valorant Practice range. Use the
              practice range to practice headshots without using Aim Labs. Check
              out Dr. Uninstall’s practice range routine – it’s freaking

              After you hit a shot – whether it be with the operator, a pistol,
              a phantom, or whatever other gun you’re using – change your
              positioning. If you keep holding the same exact position you just
              got your kill from, chances are the second person to peak you will
              get the kill because their teammate has told them exactly where
              you are.

              Shoot After Blinds Are Thrown

              Don’t be afraid to waste some bullets right after Jett or Omen or
              whoever else smokes a common spot. Most of the time, right after
              someone blinds a spot, they’re going to run to the other side of
              wherever they just smoked. I can’t tell you how many kills I’ve
              gotten from blind firing in Valorant.

              When it comes to tailoring your Valorant crosshair in the
              settings, you’ll be met with several different options and
              sliders. Each do different things and are explained as follows:
            </span>
            <span className="esports-text45"></span>
            <br></br>
            <span></span>
            <br></br>
            <span></span>
          </span>
          <span className="esports-text48">
            <span className="esports-text49"></span>
            <span className="esports-text50"></span>
            <br></br>
            <span>
              Crosshair colour: There are eight colours here to choose from.
              Ideally you want a bright, vibrant colour so it doesn’t blend with
              the map design.
            </span>
            <br></br>
            <span>
              Outlines: The outer edges of your Valorant crosshair are
              highlighted in black. This helps your crosshair stand out from any
              similarly coloured objects, but you can turn this off if you want.
              If you keep this on, you can change the opacity of these lines, as
              well as the thickness.
            </span>
            <br></br>
            <span>
              Center dot: This gives you the option to have a dot in the middle
              of your crosshair. While this isn’t necessary, those who prefer
              bigger crosshairs will like having a center point for lining up
              headshots. Like outlines, you’ll be able to change the opacity and
              the thickness of the dot if you have it enabled.
            </span>
            <br></br>
            <span>
              Fade crosshair with firing error: If this is on, the top half of
              your crosshair will fade if the spray of the automatic weapon
              you’re firing is off. This line will return when you stop firing.
              This setting can be useful as a visual reminder to watch the
              recoil pattern of guns as a new player.
            </span>
            <br></br>
            <span>
              Show spectated player’s crosshair: Fancy doing some window
              shopping? This setting will allow you to look at your teammates
              crosshairs during a match. If you like theirs better, you can
              tweak it in the settings.
            </span>
            <br></br>
            <span>
              Inner and outer lines: Further down the crosshair settings menu,
              you’ll see a number of sliders for both inner and outer lines.
              Here you can adjust the opacity, length, thickness, and distance
              to really make the crosshair your own. You can also choose to set
              each to dynamically adjust to both movement and firing.
